# p3net-tfsmigrate
Tool for migrating from TFS to VSTS and from TFVC to Git.

A full discussion is covered in my blog [P#.NET](http://www.michaeltaylorp3.net/migrating-from-tfs-to-vsts-part-1).

*Note: The code references a third pary library used at my company. The source code is not provided but the functionality is derived from code in my Kraken library which is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/CoolDadTx/kraken).
